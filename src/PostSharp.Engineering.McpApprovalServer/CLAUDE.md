# MCP Approval Server

A WPF GUI application that provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for executing privileged commands on the host machine with human approval. Used when Claude runs inside a Docker container and needs to perform operations requiring host credentials or external access.

## Architecture

### Approval Flow

1. **Request Reception**: Claude in Docker calls `ExecuteCommand` via MCP
2. **Parallel Risk Analysis**: Two analyzers run concurrently:
   - **Regex Rule Engine** (`RegexRuleEngine.cs`): Fast pattern matching against predefined rules
   - **AI Risk Analyzer** (`RiskAnalyzer.cs`): Uses Claude CLI (Haiku, escalating to Opus if uncertain)
3. **Risk Combination** (`RiskCombiner.cs`): Takes the maximum (most restrictive) of both assessments
4. **Human Approval** (`GuiApprovalPrompter.cs`): Shows approval dialog with risk assessment
5. **Execution** (`CommandExecutor.cs`): If approved, executes via PowerShell on host
6. **History Recording** (`CommandHistoryService.cs`): Records for session-based auto-approval

### Risk Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Low` | Safe operations, recommendation shown |
| `Medium` | Requires attention, manual review expected |
| `High` | Potentially dangerous, careful review required |
| `Critical` | Very dangerous, default recommendation is reject |
| `Uncertain` | AI couldn't determine - escalates to Opus, then human |

## Adding Command Rules

Rules are defined in `Mcp/Services/CommandRules.cs`. Each rule has:

- `Name`: Unique identifier for logging
- `Pattern`: Regex to match against the command
- `RiskLevel`: Low, Medium, High, or Critical
- `Recommendation`: Approve, Reject, or None (defer to AI)
- `Reason`: Human-readable explanation
- `Condition`: Optional function for context-aware matching (e.g., branch checks)

Example:
```csharp
new CommandRule
{
    Name = "git-push-to-feature",
    Pattern = new Regex( @"git\s+push", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase ),
    RiskLevel = RiskLevel.Low,
    Recommendation = Recommendation.Approve,
    Reason = "Pushing to feature/topic branch"
}
```

Rules are evaluated in order - first match wins. Place more specific rules before general ones.

## AI Risk Analysis

The `RiskAnalyzer` uses Claude CLI with a two-tier approach:

1. **Haiku first**: Fast, cheap analysis for most requests
2. **Opus escalation**: If Haiku returns `UNCERTAIN`, escalates to Opus
3. **Human fallback**: If Opus is also uncertain, defaults to Medium risk

The AI receives:
- Command and claimed purpose
- Working directory and git branch
- Session history (last 10 commands)

The Claude CLI is launched with its working directory set to the request's working
directory and is granted read-only tools (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, and read-only git
commands). Instead of embedding the commit diff in the prompt, the model inspects the
pending commits itself (`git log`/`git diff @{upstream}..HEAD`) only when it needs that
context — keeping the prompt small and analysis fast.

## Session Auto-Approval

Commands that were previously approved in the same session can be auto-approved:
- Same command text
- Same working directory
- Recorded in `CommandHistoryService`

This allows repetitive operations (like multiple pushes) without repeated approval dialogs.

## Security Considerations

- Server binds to `localhost:9847` only (not network-exposed)
- Docker accesses via host gateway IP
- All commands require human approval (no automatic execution)
- Critical operations (nuget push, repo delete, force push) default to reject
- AI analyzes commit diffs for secrets, credentials, inappropriate content
- File operations on host are forbidden (must be done in container)
