/// <summary>
/// Describes a single image in a chained-Dockerfile build. Each <see cref="ContainerComponent"/> is tagged
/// with a layer name (via <see cref="ContainerComponent.Layer"/>, default <see cref="Build"/>). When a layer
/// has at least one component it is emitted as its own <c>&lt;stem&gt;.Dockerfile</c>, building
/// <c>FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}</c> of its nearest active ancestor in the chain. The lowest active layer builds
/// <c>FROM ${OS_IMAGE_REPOSITORY}:${WINDOWS_VERSION}</c> (the external <c>&lt;root/os&gt;</c> base, which
/// defaults to <c>mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore</c> and is redirected to a registry-local mirror when
/// one is configured).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The standard chain is <c>vs17|vs18 → build → claude</c> (root → leaf). Referencing any component on a layer
/// "magically" pulls in that layer's <see cref="OwnComponents"/> (reusing the same mechanism as
/// <see cref="ContainerComponent.AddRequirements"/>). The layer's prolog is implicit: the emitter prepends a
/// <see cref="RootPrologComponent"/> (chain root) or a <see cref="ChildPrologComponent"/> (child) based on the
/// resolved parent.
