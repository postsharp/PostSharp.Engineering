/// <summary>
/// A <see cref="Publisher"/> that deploys a build's <c>.zip</c> artifact to a single target machine over SSH: the
/// archive is transferred with SCP, extracted on the target, and its <c>deploy.ps1</c> bootstrapper is run over SSH.
/// Add one instance per target machine to a build configuration's public or private publishers.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Unlike other publishers, this one performs no work at <c>b publish</c> time: the transfer and the remote bootstrap
/// are carried out by TeamCity's native <c>SSH Upload</c> and <c>SSH Exec</c> runners, which the TeamCity settings
/// generator emits into a deployment configuration. SSH publishers are grouped by their
/// <see cref="Publisher.DeploymentName"/> (defaulting to <c>ssh</c>): each group becomes one deployment configuration
/// whose steps are the SSH runners of its targets. This publisher therefore only carries the target's configuration
/// for the generator to read; its <see cref="Publish"/> method is a no-op.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The private key is provided by the TeamCity <c>SSH Agent</c> build feature, which loads the uploaded SSH key named
/// <see cref="SshKeyName"/>. All SSH publishers of the same deployment must use the same <see cref="SshKeyName"/>,
/// because a deployment configuration can load only one key into the SSH agent. Targets that need different keys can
/// be split into separate deployments by giving them distinct <see cref="Publisher.DeploymentName"/>s.
