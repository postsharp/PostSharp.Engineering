/// <remarks>
/// A mismatch here fails silently and is mis-signposted, which is why it deserves a check of its own. The generated file assigns
/// <c>PostSharpEngineeringVersion</c> unconditionally and is imported before <c>Directory.Packages.props</c>, so it alone governs
/// the version of the package that compiles the product definition. Every build then succeeds against the older package, and the
/// mismatch only surfaces when the product definition uses an API added in the newer version -- as a missing member of a type
/// that does exist, which reads as a namespace mistake rather than as a stale package.
