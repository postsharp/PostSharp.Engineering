/// The build configuration that replaces the standard <b>Build</b> action, or <c>null</c> for the standard one. A
/// product whose public build consumes what an earlier build configuration of the same product produced -- PostSharp
/// signs a distribution that an earlier configuration assembled and tested -- cannot be described by the standard
/// build step, which builds from source and depends on nothing.
/// </param>
/// <remarks>
/// The replacement states its own build steps, parameters, timeout, agent requirements and Docker specification.
/// What identifies the build configuration to the rest of the product is not its to choose and is overridden: the
/// object name, from which TeamCity derives the build type identifier that other products depend on; the display
/// name; the default branch; the published artifact rules, which the deployment reads by name; the dependencies on
/// other products; the source dependencies; and the commit status publisher. Extra artifact rules go in
/// <see cref="AdditionalArtifactRules"/> and triggers in <see cref="BuildTriggers"/>, both of which the generator
/// applies to the replacement as it does to the standard configuration.
