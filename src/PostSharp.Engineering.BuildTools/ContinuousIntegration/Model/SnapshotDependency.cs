/// <para>
/// A product whose pipeline has intermediate build configurations needs this in both directions. PostSharp builds
/// artifacts, then assembles a distribution from them, then signs it: a test cell must be able to depend on the
/// cheap configuration that produced what it consumes rather than on the expensive one at the end of the chain, and
/// the signed build must be able to depend on the distribution it signs. Both are the same relation, so both are
/// this type. An <see cref="AdditionalCiBuildConfiguration"/> declares them through
/// <see cref="AdditionalCiBuildConfiguration.SnapshotDependencies"/>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This is distinct from a dependency on another product, which is declared on the dependency definition and
/// addressed by absolute TeamCity identifier. The target here lives in the same generated project, so it is
