/// <summary>
/// The resume loop's "is this run stuck?" guard, exercised as the real PowerShell rather than as a description of
/// it.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This guard ended two real scheduled runs, both times wrongly, and each time for a different reason. It counted
/// an iteration the API had refused (an <c>API Error: 529 Overloaded</c>) as evidence that the model was looping
/// without achieving anything, when in fact the model never ran. And it measured progress as a git commit, which is
/// the right signal for an agent whose job is to change code and the wrong one for an agent whose job is anything
/// else: the nightly CEIP triage build writes rows to a database, so every iteration of a healthy run reported no
/// progress.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The two functions are extracted from the embedded resource and run in <c>pwsh</c>, because dot-sourcing the
/// script would execute it, and asserting on its text would only prove the text.
/// </para>
